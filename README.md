### ArtisticAI: Reinforcement Learning in the Realm of Creativity

Welcome to ArtisticAI, a project that explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, and the world of art. In this repository, we delve into the realm of AI-generated art and empower reinforcement learning agents to interact with and respond to artistic creations.

## Overview

ArtisticAI is an innovative initiative that aims to bridge the gap between machine intelligence and artistic expression. By training reinforcement learning agents to engage with AI-generated art, such as music or visual masterpieces, we unlock the potential for these agents to understand, interpret, and even contribute to the artistic process.
